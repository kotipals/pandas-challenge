In this project we analyzed school/student data and generated statistics to understand various trends. First we looked a summary of the district's (all the school together) overall performance. Then we looked at how each school performed. And then we looked a breakdown of each grade and their performances in math/reading. And lastly we looked at trends to see how school size, type of school, and the budget size all affected the performance of the students/school overall. The trends observed are written in the analysis portion of the report file. 

The school/student data comes in csv format and is located under the Resources directory.
And the report is named PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb and is located under the PyCitySchools directory.
